## INTRODUCTION
### Supervised Machine Learning 
Supervised learning technique deals primarily with predictive modelling where both the input data and their corresponding output response pairs are fed to the model. This process ensures that the model is trained well enough by analysing the labelled training data to predict the same for new data in the future. Examples include regression and classification.
