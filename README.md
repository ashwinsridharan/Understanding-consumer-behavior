# Exploring Consumer Behavior using Predictive Analytics

GOAL: To understand and explore consumer behavior to help the manager increase the number of customers buying organic products from the retail store.

## INTRODUCTION
### Supervised Machine Learning 
Supervised learning technique deals primarily with predictive modelling where both the input data and their corresponding output response pairs are fed to the model. This process ensures that the model is trained well enough by analysing the labelled training data to predict the same for new data in the future. Examples include regression and classification.

### Predictive Modelling
Predictive modelling is the process of using known data and results to train, validate and test a model that will predict what will happen in the future. In this process, both the input data and their corresponding output response pairs are fed to the model. This ensures that the model is trained well enough by analysing the labelled training data to predict the same for new data in the future. Examples include regression and classification.

Classification is a supervised learning technique in which the model function classifies the input data into a predefined set of classes or category. The main focus in classification is identify the class to which the data will fall. For example, if we would like to categorize emails in inbox into spam or not spam, we can use a classification model to predict under which category the new email in the inbox will fall into. Based on the training and validation of the model with labelled data, it can classify accurately for other input data in the future.

Classification is different from clustering because clustering is an unsupervised technique where it is all about pattern discovery on its own. The main focus in clustering is to group similar instances together based on their features. This type of machine learning needs no supervision as the input data has no references or labels for the algorithm to learn, enabling it to learn on its own and group the data.
