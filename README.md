## INTRODUCTION
### Unsupervised Machine Learning 
Unsupervised learning is all about pattern discovery. It is a type of machine learning where the main focus is to find regularly occurring patterns in a group of data. Usually these patterns are hidden or buried deep in the data and are undetected. This type of machine learning needs no supervision as the input data has no references or labels for the algorithm to learn, enabling it to learn on its own without any bias, gather inferences and find out patterns. Examples include association rule mining and clustering.
